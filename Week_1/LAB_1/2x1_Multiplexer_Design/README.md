# 💡 2x1 Multiplexer (Mux) Design

---

Implementation of a 2-input, 1-bit multiplexer (2x1 Mux) in Verilog/VHDL. A multiplexer is a digital switch that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output line.

## ⚙️ Specifications
### Inputs:
- **in0** (1 bit): First input signal
- **in1** (1 bit): Second input signal
- **sel** (1 bit): Selection signal that determines which input is routed to the output

### Outputs:
- **out** (1 bit): Output signal that follows either in0 or in1 based on the selection signal
